```
As a User,
So that I can see the link relevant for me,
I want to see a list of existing links in the database.

As a User,
So I can expand the database,
I want to add links to the database.

As a User,
So people can search for links easier,
I want to be able to add a tag to an existing link.

As a User,
To find my relevant link the quickest,
I want to search the database using tags.
```
